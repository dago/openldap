TBD:
- Encode/Decode von Binaerwerten, dafuer sind binaryAttributes in b64 ggf. nicht erforderlich
- decode(encode("\0")) pruefen, der Inhalt ist nicht gleich, wie werden Binaerwerte in json kodiert?

The JSON-RPC API is designed to be similar to the API used for Json2Ldap, a gateway
to access LDAP from JSON-RPC (just the opposite direction of what we are
doing here):

* Cookies

There is one important change in concept: As the invocation of the JSONRPC-backend
is done freshly for each operation there is no guarantee that the LDAP connection is
sticky to the forked JSONRPC instance. To pass information the result can always
contain a cookie with an arbitrary JSON data structure that is stored verbatim
inside LDAP server and is passed as additional parameter on all subsequent operations
of this connection. The value of the cookie can be changed with every result
returned.


BIND

There is just one BIND method which is called for all methods of binds.

Parameters:
  DN: Contains the DN for which the credentials are provided for
  method: NONE | SIMPLE | SASL | KERBEROS
  cred: The credentials supplied for the bind
  suffixes: List of suffixes for the relevant backend
  cookie: An optional data structure with arbitrary data

Result:
  error: an object containing the returncode of the operation
    message: a string containing an explanation of the error or the succeeding of the operation
    code: LDAP return code, 0 for no error and e.g. 53 for unwilling to perform
  cookie: an optional arbitrary json data object passed on every other operation during this connection

Example:

{ "method"  : "ldap.bind",
  "id"      : 1,
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "params"  : { "DN"       : "cn=myname,dc=example,dc=com",
                "method"   : "SIMPLE",
                "cred"     : "mypass",
                "suffixes" : ["dc=example,dc=com"]
              }
}

{ "error" : { "message" : "ok", "code" : 0 },
  "cookie": { "authenticated" : 0 }
}

ADD

Parameters:
  DN: Contains the DN for the object to be added
  attributes: object containing the attributes to be added. Each attribute maps to a list of strings.
  binaryAttributes: same as "attributes" but with the values being base64 encoded

Result: same as for BIND

Example:

{ "method"  : "ldap.add",
  "id"      : 1,
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "params"  : { "DN"       : "cn=myname,dc=example,dc=com",
                "attributes" : { "cn" : [ "myname" ],
                                 "sn" : [ "Arnold", "Benjamin" ]
                               },
                "binaryAttributes" : { "jpegPhoto" : [ "AA1289212ABD" ]
                                     },
                "cookie" : { "authenticated" : 1 }
              }
}

{ "error" : { "message" : "ok", "code" : 0 },
  "cookie": { "authenticated" : 0 }
}

SEARCH

Parameters:
  baseDN: The base DN where the search starts
  filter: filter string
  typesOnly: boolean containing if only types should be returned for the results
  scope: "BASE" | "ONE" | "SUB" | "SUBORDINATES"
  deref: "NEVER" | "SEARCHING" | "FINDING" | "ALWAYS"
  sizeLimit: number with the maximum number of results to be returned, 0 means no limit
  timeLimit: seconds for the maximum duration the operation may take, 0 means no limit
  attributes: list of strings containing attribute names with the value to be returned as strings
  binaryAttributes: list of strings containing attribute names with the values to be returned as base64

Result:
  error: an object containing the returncode of the operation
    message: a string containing an explanation of the error or the succeeding of the operation
    code: LDAP return code, 0 for no error and e.g. 53 for unwilling to perform
  cookie: an optional arbitrary json data object passed on every other operation during this connection
  matches: either an LDIF string with one entry or an object containing attributes and their values or a
    list of LDIF strings or objects

Example:

{ "method"  : "ldap.searach",
  "id"      : 1,
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "params"  : { "baseDN"       : "cn=myname,dc=example,dc=com",
                "filter"       : "(objectclass=*)",
                 "typesOnly"   : False,
                 "scope"       : "SUB",
                 "deref"       : "NEVER",
                 "attributes"  : [ "cn", "sn" ]
              },
  "cookie" : { "authenticated" : 0 }
}

{ "error" : { "message" : "ok", "code" : 0 },
  "cookie": { "authenticated" : 0 },
  "matches" : [ { "dn" : "cn=myname,dc=example,dc=com", "cn" : "myname", "sn" : [ "Arnold", "Benjamin" ] } ]
}
